This is my first attempt at webdesign. I created this page using various online tutorials and resources such as the Mozilla Developers Network, W3 Schools, numerous youtube tutorials, and knowledge learned from taking online classes with Udacity and Code Academy.

The inspiration for choosing the Bower Honey Company comes from a mix of wanting to do something nice to show my father (the CEO of Bower Honey Company) and because the honey bee lends itself amazingly to photography and design. As a child I would help my father in the bee yeards and remember that time fondly (even if I didn't appreaciate it at the time).
