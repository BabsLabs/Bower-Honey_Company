Everyone loves honey! This is a frontend only application for Bower Honey Company made to practice modern design technologies such as CSS Grid and Flexbox.

## Purpose

The inspiration for choosing the Bower Honey Company comes from a mix of wanting to do something nice to show my father (the CEO of Bower Honey Company) and because the honey bee lends itself amazingly to photography and design. As a child I would help my father in the bee yeards and remember that time fondly (even if I didn't appreaciate it at the time).

## Tech/Framework Used

* CSS Grid
* CSS Flexbox
* HTML5
